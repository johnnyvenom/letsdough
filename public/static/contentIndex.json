But it can help speed up cooking time the next day. This can be helpful if the beans are older (though you wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be able to tell).\n\nPreparation\nCook the beans\nDrain and rinse the black beans (presoaked or not). Put them in a big pot and add enough cold water to cover the beans by a couple inches. (You can alternately replace 1/2 of the water with vegetable stock too, just watch the salt level at the end.) Add a few bay leaves and bring to a boil.\nOnce boiling, reduce to a simmer and cover. They will cook for anywhere between 1.5 to 5 hours, depending on the beans.\nStir every 20 minutes or so, and make sure they don‚Äôt stick to the bottom. If they do, the heat is too high. Reduce it. If the water level reaches the top of the beans, add more. The idea is to keep them covered, but not totally drowned, because at the end we want the beans to have a nice thick consistency and not be too watery/liquidy.\nPrepare the sofrito\nWhile the beans are cooking, you‚Äôll make a sofrito. Chop the onions, bell peppers, chile peppers (if using, watch the heat though!), and garlic.\nIn a large skillet, heat a good amount of olive oil to medium heat. Add the onions and saute them for a couple minutes. Add in the peppers (bell and chile) and continue to sautee. Once everything is softened (around 5 - 8 minutes), add the garlic. Cook for a couple more minutes untill everything is fragrant.\nTurn the heat to low, add all the dried spices and salt. Add more olive oil so everything is well coated and stir well to combine. Take off heat.\nCombine everything\nWhen the beans are starting to get soft and the liquid starts to thicken, add the sofrito to the beans. Use a spatula to make sure you get all the good fragrant oils from the skillet.\nMix well and continue to cook the beans towards their desired consistency.\nAt this point, start tasting frequently, and adjust the following:\n\nSalt: add to achieve proper depth of flavour.\nHeat: add cayenne or red chili flakes to give the appropriate amount of heat\nOptional: Squeeze the juice of 1 or 2 limes in to give a hit of brightness.\n\nThe beans are finished when they arrive at the consistency you want. If for tacos, you‚Äôll want them thicker. If you want to eat as a soup or put over rice (classic beans and rice) you might want them a bit more liquidy.\n\nüí° You can leave them on the more liquidy side, and store them this way. When you want some for tacos, refry them in a skillet and this will cook off some of the liquid making a great taco consistency.\n\nTo serve\nSo many ways to serve these beans:\n\nIn tacos, burritos, tostadas, etc. with Guacamole and other toppings\nWith tortilla chips, alongside guac and pico de gallo\nBeans and rice\nBlack bean bowls\n\nThis recipe makes a ton.

Mix again and taste to check lime/salt balance. Add more of either if needed.\nChop the tomato, and wash, dry, and rough chop the cilantro. Add them to the guac, and mix again.\nTaste again. You probably need more salt.

(You can also skip this step and just use canned.)\n\n\n1kg of dried chickpeas should be plenty for a few batches of hummus. They will more than double in size once they are soaked and cooked.\n\nRinse your dried chickpeas well in cold water, then put them in a large pot and cover them with plenty of water. Leave them to soak overnight.\nThe next day, drain the soaking water and give the chickpeas a rinse if they seem like they need it (if the water looks cloudy or dirty). Cover the chickpeas with fresh cold water. Peel an onion, cut it in half and throw it in. Peel and crush a couple garlic cloves and throw the pieces in the water. Add a few bay leaves.\n\nüßë‚Äçüî¨ At this point you can also add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda or salt. This is optional, but can aid in softening the skins of chickpeas to make them cook faster and make the resulting consistency more smooth. In particular this can be a good step if the chickpeas still seem very hard after soaking. This usually indicates they are somewhat old (but still fine to use) and could use a little extra help. I haven‚Äôt personally tried the salt trick but there seems to be some science behind it (link needed‚Ä¶)\n\nCook the chickpeas until they are tender but not yet falling apart. Depending on the age of the beans it could be as fast as 20 min or as long at 2 hours.\n\nüö® If you used baking soda pay attention, as they may soften fast and turn to mush of you don‚Äôt take them off in time.\n\nDrain the water and discard the bay leaves and onion. Cool and store the chickpeas, or move on to making hummus. (If you make hummus right away, make sure the chickpeas are fully cooled.)\nMaking the hummus\nEverything goes in a food processor. If you don‚Äôt have a food processor, an immersion blender is fine, or even a potato masher will work in a pinch.\n\nüßÆ If you cooked 1kg of dried beans, you can make roughly four batches of hummus. As with most of these recipes, amounts are estimated, so make as much or as little as you like. The following steps assume about 1/4 of your total cooked chickpeas\n\n\nCrush and peel 1 large or 2 medium cloves of garlic and pulse them in the food processor until they are finely minced.\nAdd the chickpeas and pulse them a few times to break them up.\nAdd a few spoonfuls of tahini. No real measure here, but say anywhere up to 1/4 cup (0.5 dl).\nAdd around 1/2 teaspoon (3g) of salt\nAdd around 1 tsp of cumin and a pinch of cayenne. Be careful with the cayenne, the point is not to make spicy hummus but just a little will activate your tastebuds so the other flavours really pop.\nSqueeze in the juice of 1 lemon.\nAdd a healthy glug of olive oil\nStart pulsing the food processor, then leave it on as it starts to mix through all of the ingredients. It will still be chunky and dry but that‚Äôs fine.\nDrop in 1 - 2 ice cubes while the food processor is running and let them get crushed and mixed in.\n\nLeave the food processor running for at least a minute or two. Watch the consistency of the hummus, it should smooth out very nicely. If it‚Äôs not getting smooth add another ice cube or two, and/or some olive oil.\nStop the food processor and scrape down the sides if needed.\nKeep mixing it, stopping occasionally to check taste and consistency.\n\nTaste:\n\nCheck there is enough salt and add if needed.\nNote the cumin, you should taste a little but not have it overpower. Add more if needed\nAdd more lemon juice if it feels a little dull.\n\n\nConsistency:\n\nIf it seems thick and cement-like, continue to add some ice (or olive oil) and keep mixing.\n\n\n\nWhen it all seems nice and velvety smooth, and tastes delicious, you are done.\nTo serve\nPut the hummus into a nice serving dish. Sprinkle liberally with zataar and drizzle some olive oil over the top.\nServe with baguette, crackers, pita, pickles, olives, etc. Make it into sandwiches, use it in place of mayonnaise, have it on your toast in the morning, add it to your skin care routine, etc.\nIf you made lots of extra cooked chickpeas, you can just pull them out of your freezer and have fresh hummus in minutes that tastes better and is way cheaper than store-bought.
