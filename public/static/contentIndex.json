I made my first starter Rupert and eventually got my tools and techniques dialed in to produce consistently decent bread. I gave jars of Rupert to all my friends and they started baking too. In 2020, I was still experimenting and changed the formulation of the starter, dubbing it Mabel. She served us well until 2022 when we headed to Paris, land of incredible baked goods and very small apartment kitchens. Bread baking was on hiatus until we returned to Montr√©al in fall 2024. My friend F√©lix has been keeping his Rupert fork going and baking incredible loaves since the early days, and returned some starter to me.

I‚Äôve adapted it to my own, taking into account the local Canadian flours available here, the climate, and my own experiences and preferences (especially the sesame seeds!)\nThe recipe is broken up into 4 steps: sourdough starter, day-before prep, day-of making, and next-day baking.\n\n\nCooking time\nThis bread is ideally made over three days, though the bulk of the work is on the second day.\n\nDay 1 (evening): 10 minutes\n\nFeed the starter / create levain\nMix the autolyse\n\n\nDay 2: Up to 1 hour of active work, 4 - 8 hours doing occasional folds\n\nMix the dough\nBulk fermentation\nShape loaf\n\n\nDay 3: 10 min active work, 1 hr baking time\n\nIngredients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmountIngredients100gsourdough starter (see starter section below)375gunbleached organic white bread flour125gorganic whole wheat flour350gwater12gsea saltrice flour (optional)sesame seeds\nYou‚Äôll also want these tools:\n\nkitchen scale\nbanneton (proofing basket) - I prefer the batard-shape (oblong) with a cloth liner like these\nbread lame (or sharp razor blade) to score the top of the loaf\nspray bottle that can produce a fine mist\n\nSteps\n0. Sourdough starter\nBefore starting you need to have a good and healthy sourdough starter. Ideally this is one you have and maintain, because it needs regular feeding to stay fresh and usable. I won‚Äôt go into detail about how to make a starter or how to maintain it1, but essentially you want it to be nice and bubbly. You can achieve this by feeding it roughly once a week and keeping it in the refrigerator.\nTo feed the starter, mix equal parts flour (I like to use rye flour), water, and existing starter together. Discard the rest of the old starter.\nI. Day before prep\nThere are two steps to do the day before. One is essential, the other is optional.\n1: Create your levain (essential)\nWhat is levain? Essentially it is just an off-shoot of your starter, made the night before to guarantee that it is fresh, ready to use, and suits the properties of the bread you want to make. For simplicy‚Äôs sake, this levain will just be the same as my starter, measured to be the right quantity for my bread.\nYou want 100g of starter, so combine 33g of existing starter, 33g of flour (your choice, but I stick with rye as it gives the bread a nice earthy nutty flavour), and 33g of water. Mix it in a medium size bowl or container that you can cover well. Put it in a warm-ish spot in your kitchen and leave for between 8 and 16 hours (e.g., overnight). When you are ready to proceed the next day, it should be slightly liquidy and bubbly.\n\nüí° This is also probably a good time to feed your regular starter and stick it back in the fridge till you are ready to bake next.\n\n2: Create your autolyse (optional)\nWhat is an autolyse? It‚Äôs a fancy word for the flour and water you‚Äôll use for your dough. Creating the autolyse beforehand lets the flour hydrate well and the dough it will become soft and silky smooth over time. Check for the ‚Äúwindowpane effect‚Äù after it has sat overnight, where you can pull a bit of the autolyse apart and it will stretch very thin but not tear, so the stretched centre is a bit translucent.\n\nüö® You don‚Äôt have to do this the night before, you could do it the following morning, but make sure the autolyse has at least a couple hours to sit before adding the levain.\n\nGet a big bowl and find a lid that can cover it well.\nWeigh and combine your flours.2 Mix them together with a whisk.\nMeasure the water by weight (on a scale) or in a measuring cup (1g water = 1ml) and add to the flour. Mix the flour and water together by hand until it is well combined into a sticky ball. Use a dough scraper to get all the bits off the sides of the bowl (and off your fingers) and shape it as best you can into a ball.\nLeave the autolyse in the big bowl and cover it. Leave it overnight. (Or do this in the morning, leaving it for at least two hours before continuing.)\nII. On the day\n\nüéâ Today is the day you ‚Äúmake‚Äù the bread, though you won‚Äôt bake it until the following day. But this is where all the work is.\n\n1: Combine the ingredients\n\nGet our your autolyse. Everything will happen here in this bowl.\nPut it on a scale, and then weigh in 100g of your beautiful bubbly levain. (Your levain should be about 100g, but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to check the weight just to be sure.)\nUse your hands to mix and knead the levain and autolyse together.\nOnce they are getting well combined (~2 minutes of mixing), add the salt.\nContinue hand mixing/kneading until everything is very well combined, approximately 2 minutes more.\nMound it up in a ball and leave it in the bowl. Cover it with a lid (or wet tea towel if you don‚Äôt have a lid that fits).\n\n2: Bulk fermentation\nIn the bulk fermentation step, you‚Äôll let the dough do its thing for a few hours while the naturally formed yeasts convert sugars into gas yada, yada, yada‚Ä¶ until the dough gets a bit bubbly and roughly doubles in size.\n\n\n                  \n                  How do you tell when the buk fermentation is done? \n                  \n                \n\nOnce your dough is all combined in the last step, cut off a little golf-ball-sized chunk of the dough. Put it in a small narrow glass jar. Let it settle to the bottom, then put a small rubber band around it to mark where the dough comes up to on the side of the jar. This is your measuring tool. Keep an eye on this, and when the top of the dough has risen to double its size, you know the fermentation step is complete. See The Bread Code‚Äôs video (although I prefer a narrower jar to make it easier to read).\n\n\nPerform a stretch and fold on the dough each 15 minutes for the first 2 - 3 hours. This promotes gluten formation and strengthens the dough. So you can basically keep living your life, pause to do the stretch and fold, set at timer for another 15 minutes, and go back to your business until it goes off again.\n\nüí° Run your hands under water so they are wet when you fold the dough; it won‚Äôt stick and is much easier to work with. (And obviously, always wash your hands before you touch the dough!!)\n\nAfter about 2 hours, increase the time between folds til 30 minutes, and after about 4 or 5 hours, increase the time to 1 hour. The longer the fermentation time, the gentler you want to be with the dough too. All those little foamy bubbles mean it‚Äôs working, so go softly and try not to disrupt the dough too much.\n\n\n                  \n                  Ok fine but really how do I know when the fermentation is done? \n                  \n                \n\nThe exact amount of time for this step depends on a myriad of interconnected variables: the hydration (water amount) of the dough, type of flours used, the humidity, ambient room temperature, etc. It could be as short as 3 hours and as long as 8 hours or more. My fermentation times are usually somewhere between 5 and 7 hours, but it‚Äôs different every time.\nLook for these signs to know your fermentation is done:\n\nThe dough has many little air pockets (larger bubbles) under the surface.\nIt‚Äôs pliable and jiggly, but still maintains its surface tension and elasticity.\nYour little jar/measuring tool shows you it‚Äôs roughly doubled in size.\n\nüö® DO NOT OVER FERMENT YOUR DOUGH!! If you do, all is lost; you‚Äôll have a sad flat loaf. In my experience it is much better to under-ferment than over-ferment. Keep in mind the loaf will proof in the fridge overnight.\nAs with almost all of these steps, it just takes a lot of practice and experience. Eventually you will just start to be able read all the little telltale signs and hit it right every single time.\n\n\n3. Shaping the loaf\nWhen the dough reaches proper fermentation level, it‚Äôs ready to be shaped into a loaf and put in the fridge to proof overnight.\nPrepare your banneton by knocking out any old flour and dusting it with new rice flour. If you don‚Äôt have rice flour use whatever flour you have on hand.\nLiberally sprinkle bread or all purpose flour on a clean countertop. Gently flop the dough out of the bowl onto the flour and arrange it in a semi-rectangular or oval shape facing away from you (e.g., ‚Äúportrait mode‚Äù). Make sure there is plenty of flour and it‚Äôs not sticking to the countertop.\nTaking care not to tear the dough, gently pull out the top third of the dough and fold it back onto itself. Repeat with the bottom third, so your dough is in three layers.\nEven it out as best you can then rotate it 90¬∞ so the long way is facing away from you. Starting at the distant end, gently stretch the dough and roll it up back towards you. You‚Äôll end with a jiggly frumpy Swiss Cake Roll looking thing. Perfect!\nRoll the dough over so the seam created from the roll-up is on the bottom. Gently but firmly complete the shaping so it forms a nice oblong loaf shape. If your fermentation steps have gone right, the dough should have nice strength and stay nicely‚Ä¶ loafed. You can pinch the ends together to give it more‚Ä¶ loafeyness.\nInvert and place the loaf in the banneton so the nice side is down and the seam side is up. You can pinch the seam together if you like. (Consult numerous YouTube videos for good shaping technique!)\nDust it with more flour, place it in a plastic bag and seal it, and put it in the refrigerator overnight.\nIII. Baking day!\nYour bread will proof overnight and increase in size. Like with the bulk fermentation, it is important to know precisely when the bread is properly proofed and ready to bake. Too soon or too late and the bread won‚Äôt rise well and your loaf will be flat and stupid. üí©\n\n\n                  \n                  How to know that your bread is proofed and ready to bake \n                  \n                \n\n\nLook at it. Has it grown in size? Good. It might be ready‚Ä¶\nPoke it.\n\n‚è≥ If it quickly springs back, it‚Äôs not ready. Put it back in the fridge for another couple hours.\nüö´ If it barely springs back, or doesn‚Äôt at all, you‚Äôve over-proofed. All is lost. Eat your sad flat bread in shame.\n‚úÖ If it slowly springs back, you‚Äôve hit it just right and it‚Äôs ready to bake.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Preparation\nPut a big dutch oven into your oven on a low rack. Remove the other racks to give plenty of space. Preheat the oven to 230¬∞C.\n\nüßë‚Äçüî¨ If you don‚Äôt have a dutch oven that can fit your loaf of bread, you can use a pizza stone if you have one, or barring that you can cook the loaf on a baking sheet. But each will give you slightly inferior results.\n\nThe dutch oven will keep steam in, creating the best environment for oven spring.\nThe pizza stone will not hold the steam in, but the mass of the stone will hold high and consistent heat.\nThe cooking sheet is the least optimal option, but if you‚Äôve done a good fermentation and proof it should come out okay.\n\nIf using a dutch oven or pizza stone, let the oven run for an additional 20 to 30 minutes after preheating to ensure the dutch oven/stone is fully up to temperature.\n\nGet all the things you need together:\n\nLoaf out of fridge and plastic off\nLarge piece of parchment paper on counter\nA bowl or cup of sesame seeds\nFood-safe spray bottle of water, on fine mist setting\nYour bread lame or razor\nA bowl with a few ice cubes in it\nYour oven mitts to handle the dutch oven\n\n2. Baking\nBecause you want the dutch oven to maintain its optimal heat, you‚Äôll want to do all the steps to get your loaf into the oven quickly and efficiently.\n\nTurn the loaf out onto middle of the parchment paper, with the bottom (in the banneton) now on top\nFinely mist the top with water - only lightly, this is just so the sesame seeds stick\nLiberally sprinkle sesame seeds over the top and on the sides. Pat them lightly so they stick but don‚Äôt disturb the dough too much.\nTake the bread lame or razor and score a curved line down the top of the loaf. Add other small scores on the side if you like too. (Again, there is an art to this, consult images and videos on the internet!)\nPut on your oven mitts and take the dutch oven out of the oven. Take the lid off. (If not using a dutch oven, you can adapt the remaining steps as necessary‚Ä¶)\nLift the parchment paper with the loaf on it and place it in the dutch oven.\nPlace a couple ice cubes in the dutch oven at the edges underneath the parchment paper so they don‚Äôt directly contact the loaf.\nPut your mitts back on, put the lid on the dutch oven and place it back in the oven.\n\nCook for 30 minutes, then take the lid off. Look to see if the loaf has risen nicely. This is the moment of truth! If things have gone perfectly the bread should have a nice ear on it.\nTurn the oven light on and continue cooking the loaf for 15 to 25 minutes. Check the color and wait for it to turn a nice rich brown. Try not to open the oven too much (thus the light on so you can watch it).\nWhen it is done, remove the dutch oven and carefully lift the loaf out by the parchment paper.\nPlace it on a wire rack to full cool before eating.\nTo serve\nIt is best to let the bread rest for a few hours before eating. When it first comes out the inside will still be quite moist and difficult to cut cleanly.\nAfter a few hours, you can eat it, or store it in a paper bag until the next day.\nIf you do eat it the same day, keep it in a paper bag for the rest of the day, and then place it in a plastic bag before you go to bed. Essentially you are controlling the amount of humidity by doing this. (Also this is good practice for fresh bakery breads you buy!)\nThere are a million ways to eat great bread. Our favourites:\n\nToast with almond butter in the mornings\nAvocado (or guacamole) toast!\nTomato, cheese and mayo sandwiches\nHummus sandwiches\nSliced fresh or toasted on a cheese plate\nAccompanying soups, salads, etc.\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Conclusion \n                  \n                \n\nBreadmaking is a true art form. I‚Äôm glad to have learned some basics, but truthfully there is so much more to learn and experiment with. This is only the beginning. It is also a nuanced and meticulous process that take a lot of practice to get just right. (It‚Äôs taken me a few hours just to write out this recipe üòÖ) But it is also fun to learn and the bread that comes out is honestly the best bread you will ever have‚Ä¶ mostly because YOU MADE IT!!\nEnjoy!\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nSee The Bread Code‚Äôs amazingly informative and detailed ‚ÄúThe Sourdough Framework‚Äù for all the information you need about making and maintaining your own starter. ‚Ü©\n\n\nThis recipe uses 75% white bread flour and 25% whole wheat. You can adjust these proportions as you like, but bear in mind that too much whole wheat flour can make your bread kind of cardboard-ey and will typically require higher hydration (more water). Using other types of flours can be fun too, though you will have to experiment with the other parameters of the recipe (amount of water, fermentation and proofing time, etc.) to get great results. ‚Ü©\n\n\n"},"Dips-dressings-and-spreads/Guacamole":{"title":"Guacamole","links":[],"tags":["tacos","Mexican"],"content":"I lived in New Mexico for 6 years and learned a few things, but probably none so valuable as making incredible guacamole.\n\n\n                  \n                  ü•± TL;DR \n                  \n                \n\n(read on for the long version)\n\nMash up two avocados in a bowl\nAdd minced red or white onion, jalape√±o, garlic (small clove or 1/2), juice of 1/2 a lime, and 1/2 tsp salt\nMix well.\nAdd 1/2 chopped tomato and rough chopped cilantro to taste.\nServe immediately, or squeeze some extra lime juice over the top and refrigerate for up to a few hours.\n\n\n\nFull recipe\nCooking time\n\n10 min\n\nIngredients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmountIngredients2 mediumavocados1/4 cupwhite or red onion (if using yellow, use less)1/2 to 1jalape√±o (taste the pepper first to see how hot it is)1 small clovegarlic1lime (juiced)1/2 tspsalt (more or less to taste)1/2 mediumtomatohandfulcilantro (optional)\nSteps\nSlice two avocados in half.

(You can also skip this step and just use canned.)\n\n\n1kg of dried chickpeas should be plenty for a few batches of hummus. They will more than double in size once they are soaked and cooked.\n\nRinse your dried chickpeas well in cold water, then put them in a large pot and cover them with plenty of water. Leave them to soak overnight.\nThe next day, drain the soaking water and give the chickpeas a rinse if they seem like they need it (if the water looks cloudy or dirty). Cover the chickpeas with fresh cold water. Peel an onion, cut it in half and throw it in. Peel and crush a couple garlic cloves and throw the pieces in the water. Add a few bay leaves.\n\nüßë‚Äçüî¨ At this point you can also add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda or salt. This is optional, but can aid in softening the skins of chickpeas to make them cook faster and make the resulting consistency more smooth. In particular this can be a good step if the chickpeas still seem very hard after soaking. This usually indicates they are somewhat old (but still fine to use) and could use a little extra help. I haven‚Äôt personally tried the salt trick but there seems to be some science behind it (link needed‚Ä¶)\n\nCook the chickpeas until they are tender but not yet falling apart. Depending on the age of the beans it could be as fast as 20 min or as long at 2 hours.\n\nüö® If you used baking soda pay attention, as they may soften fast and turn to mush of you don‚Äôt take them off in time.\n\nDrain the water and discard the bay leaves and onion. Cool and store the chickpeas, or move on to making hummus. (If you make hummus right away, make sure the chickpeas are fully cooled.)\nMaking the hummus\nEverything goes in a food processor. If you don‚Äôt have a food processor, an immersion blender is fine, or even a potato masher will work in a pinch.\n\nüßÆ If you cooked 1kg of dried beans, you can make roughly four batches of hummus. As with most of these recipes, amounts are estimated, so make as much or as little as you like. The following steps assume about 1/4 of your total cooked chickpeas\n\n\nCrush and peel 1 large or 2 medium cloves of garlic and pulse them in the food processor until they are finely minced.\nAdd the chickpeas and pulse them a few times to break them up.\nAdd a few spoonfuls of tahini. No real measure here, but say anywhere up to 1/4 cup (0.5 dl).\nAdd around 1/2 teaspoon (3g) of salt\nAdd around 1 tsp of cumin and a pinch of cayenne. Be careful with the cayenne, the point is not to make spicy hummus but just a little will activate your tastebuds so the other flavours really pop.\nSqueeze in the juice of 1 lemon.\nAdd a healthy glug of olive oil\nStart pulsing the food processor, then leave it on as it starts to mix through all of the ingredients. It will still be chunky and dry but that‚Äôs fine.\nDrop in 1 - 2 ice cubes while the food processor is running and let them get crushed and mixed in.\n\nLeave the food processor running for at least a minute or two. Watch the consistency of the hummus, it should smooth out very nicely. If it‚Äôs not getting smooth add another ice cube or two, and/or some olive oil.\nStop the food processor and scrape down the sides if needed.\nKeep mixing it, stopping occasionally to check taste and consistency.\n\nTaste:\n\nCheck there is enough salt and add if needed.\nNote the cumin, you should taste a little but not have it overpower. Add more if needed\nAdd more lemon juice if it feels a little dull.\n\n\nConsistency:\n\nIf it seems thick and cement-like, continue to add some ice (or olive oil) and keep mixing.\n\n\n\nWhen it all seems nice and velvety smooth, and tastes delicious, you are done.\nTo serve\nPut the hummus into a nice serving dish. Sprinkle liberally with zataar and drizzle some olive oil over the top.\nServe with baguette, crackers, pita, pickles, olives, etc. Make it into sandwiches, use it in place of mayonnaise, have it on your toast in the morning, add it to your skin care routine, etc.\nIf you made lots of extra cooked chickpeas, you can just pull them out of your freezer and have fresh hummus in minutes that tastes better and is way cheaper than store-bought.

But it can help speed up cooking time the next day. This can be helpful if the beans are older (though you wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be able to tell).\n\n\nPreparation\nCook the beans\nDrain and rinse the black beans (presoaked or not). Put them in a big pot and add enough cold water to cover the beans by a couple inches. (You can alternately replace 1/2 of the water with vegetable stock too, just watch the salt level at the end.) Add a few bay leaves and bring to a boil.\nOnce boiling, reduce to a simmer and cover. They will cook for anywhere between 1.5 to 5 hours, depending on the beans.\nStir every 20 minutes or so, and make sure they don‚Äôt stick to the bottom. If they do, the heat is too high. Reduce it. If the water level reaches the top of the beans, add more. The idea is to keep them covered, but not totally drowned, because at the end we want the beans to have a nice thick consistency and not be too watery/liquidy.\nPrepare the sofrito\nWhile the beans are cooking, you‚Äôll make a sofrito. Chop the onions, bell peppers, chile peppers (if using, watch the heat though!), and garlic.\nIn a large skillet, heat a good amount of olive oil to medium heat. Add the onions and saute them for a couple minutes. Add in the peppers (bell and chile) and continue to sautee. Once everything is softened (around 5 - 8 minutes), add the garlic. Cook for a couple more minutes untill everything is fragrant.\nTurn the heat to low, add all the dried spices and salt. Add more olive oil so everything is well coated and stir well to combine. Take off heat.\nCombine everything\nWhen the beans are starting to get soft and the liquid starts to thicken, add the sofrito to the beans. Use a spatula to make sure you get all the good fragrant oils from the skillet.\nMix well and continue to cook the beans towards their desired consistency.\nAt this point, start tasting frequently, and adjust the following:\n\nSalt: add to achieve proper depth of flavour.\nHeat: add cayenne or red chili flakes to give the appropriate amount of heat\nOptional: Squeeze the juice of 1 or 2 limes in to give a hit of brightness.\n\nThe beans are finished when they arrive at the consistency you want. If for tacos, you‚Äôll want them thicker. If you want to eat as a soup or put over rice (classic beans and rice) you might want them a bit more liquidy.\n\nüí° You can leave them on the more liquidy side, and store them this way. When you want some for tacos, refry them in a skillet and this will cook off some of the liquid making a great taco consistency.\n\nTo serve\nSo many ways to serve these beans:\n\nIn tacos, burritos, tostadas, etc. with Guacamole and other toppings\nWith tortilla chips, alongside guac and pico de gallo\nBeans and rice\nBlack bean bowls\n\nThis recipe makes a ton.

Go nuts, it‚Äôs your scramble. The important thing to pay attention to is the required cooking time for each. Things like potatoes and root vegetables need to go in early, and save any leafy things for the end.\nSame with the herbs: fresh herbs really make the dish and you can use a variety. But use some caution, and think about how they will go with the other spices you put in - e.g., rosemary, sage, and cumin/coriander isn‚Äôt necessarily a great combo. So, as always, experiment and use your taste buds to guide you to lovely combinations. For dried herbs, herbs de provence go a long way.\nSteps\n\nüí°To be neat and orderly, chop all your vegetables first, then you will add them to your skillet one by one, based on the time they each need to cook. Functionally speaking though, chop the first ones to get them cooking, then you can be chopping the next as they cook, throw them in, move on to the next, etc.\n\nChop the onion and peppers into thin strips. Finely mince the garlic. Chop up the broccoli into smallish florets (if you want you can peel and chop the stems too), chop the mushrooms to similar dimensions as the broccoli (chunks are better than sliced in this recipe), and similarly chop up any other veggies you are going to use.\nGet out your biggest skillet and heat it to medium. Add a liberal glug of olive oil.\nAdd the onions and cook for a couple minutes until the all break apart and just barely start to soften. Then add the bell peppers. If you have other veggies that require longer cooking times (carrots, potatoes, broccoli stems, etc.) add them here too. Cook until things start to soften a bit, maybe 5 min. more. Add the garlic, spices, salt, and half of the fresh herbs. If using dried herbs, add them here too. Stir it all together, adding more olive oil if everything is getting dry. Everything should start to smell nice and fragrant now.\nCheck your heat, things should be sizzling nicely but not burning or sticking to the bottom. Adjust as necessary.\nAdd the broccoli next and any other medium-cook-time veggies. Mix it in well.\nThen break the tofu apart with your hands and crumble it in. Pieces can vary in size, but go for a median size of 3/4‚Äù cubes. Mix together well with everything.\nAdd in the mushrooms and combine well. Cook for a few minutes more until they start breaking down, then add your leafy vegetables (if using), most of the rest of the herbs (reserving a little for a fresh garnish), and the nutritional yeast. Combine well and continue stirring.\nTaste and adjust salt and spices as needed. If everything is too dry add some more olive oil (or if really health conscious, add a little water). Check for the doneness of the different vegetables - they should be cooked but still have a little crunch to them. Total cooking time should be somewhere around 20 minutes.\nWhen everything is done to your liking take it off the heat. Optional: squeeze the juice if 1/2 lime in and mix to give it a nice brightness.\nTo serve\nPlate it, topping with remaining fresh herbs and/or chopped fresh parsley, and a wedge of lemon.\nA dollop of vegenaise (or regular mayo) and some hot sauce is a great accompaniment.\nOur go-to service is this scramble with a side of baked sweet potato1 and crunchy kale salad.\nFootnotes\n\n\nFast sweet potato recipe: cube a large sweet potato; toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper; bake on parchment paper-covered baking sheet at 175¬∞C / 375¬∞F for about 20 min, turning once. Take out, place in large bowl and toss with a little more salt. Boom.

You can also use a vegan cooking creme if you prefer. If not vegan, you can use heavy creme (35% in Canada), and feel free to toss in a little butter to richen it up too.\n\n\nSteps\nPrep: mise en place, people!\n\nWash potatoes and cut into large cubes, leaving the skin on.\nTrim green and base parts of leeks and discard. Slice the remaining white parts in half length-wise. Wash them thoroughly. If they are very dirty, submerge the halves in a large bowl of cold water and let them soak for a while.\nOnce clean, roughly chop the leeks on a bias (diagonal).\nMince your garlic and dice the onion if using. (Onion rule of thumb - if you have tons of leeks, don‚Äôt bother, but if not, that extra onion adds a lot)\nWash your herbs.\nCover 150g (around 1 cup) of raw cashews with very hot water and let them soak. Optionally, smash a clove of garlic and put it in. (Skip this step if using regular creme)\n\nLet‚Äôs cook:\n\nHeat a large dutch oven or pot to medium heat and add a generous amount of olive oil.\nAdd the leeks and onion (if using) and saut√© until they start to soften. Mind that they don‚Äôt brown.\nAdd garlic and red pepper flakes.\nTake a good bunch of dill and thyme (or any other fresh herbs) and make a little bundle, tying it with some cooking twine. Throw it in and mix it around. (Or use a rubber band, though maybe that‚Äôs not great for cooking? But either way you‚Äôll fish it out later‚Ä¶)\nAfter the garlic and herbs have cooked another minute or so, add the potatoes and stir them around for a couple minutes until everything is well mixed and sizzling.\nAdd enough vegetable stock to cover everything well. If you‚Äôre not going full vegan, feel free to add some butter here.\nCover and reduce to a simmer.\nStir and check the firmness of the potatoes every few minutes.\nWhile the soup cooks, make your cashew creme (if using). Ensuring there is enough water still covering the cashews, use a hand blender to blend it all into a creme. Adjust the amount of water to get the right consistency (start with less, and add as you go). Taste and add salt as needed.\nWhen the potatoes are soft, fish out the herb bundle and throw it away.\nUse a potato masher or hand blender to break down some of the potatoes. It‚Äôs up to you how creamy you want to make the soup - I usually like to leave it a bit chunky.\nAdd more fresh herbs and salt and pepper to taste. Everything should taste pretty great now.\nFinal step: stir in a good amount of the cashew creme (or regular creme). This will give the soup an exceptional mouthfeel.\n\n\nTo serve\nDish out into a shallow bowl. Add a swizzle of creme in the bowl if you are feeling fancy. Top with more fresh dill, a dusting of paprika, and fresh cracked pepper.\nServe with baguette, crusty sourdough bread, or grilled cheese sandwich, and a fresh (kale) salad."},"index":{"title":"üå± Welcome.","links":["Breads-and-baking/Whole-wheat-sourdough-bread","Beverages/Lemon-water","Dips-dressings-and-spreads/Salad-dressing","Dips-dressings-and-spreads/Guacamole","Dips-dressings-and-spreads/Hummus","Soups/Potato-Leek-Soup","Mains/Black-beans","Mains/Lentil-burgers","Mains/Spicy-Vodka-Rigatoni","Mains/Tofu-scramble-(dinner)","Linked-recipes"],"tags":[],"content":"\nHi.
