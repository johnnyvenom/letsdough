| 1/4 cup       | *white* or *red* onion (if using yellow, use less)     |

### Steps

Slice two avocados in half. Remove the seed and scoop out the flesh with a soup spoon into a large bowl. Roughly mash the avocado with the back of a fork. 

> ðŸ’¡  If the flesh is hard to mash, put the avocado halves face down on a cutting board and fork mash them here, then scoop it back into the bowl. 

Mince the onion, jalapeÃ±o, and garlic. Add it to the avocado using amounts that make sense to you. (Check how hot that jalapeÃ±o is, as they vary widely!)

Mix the ingredients quickly, but keep the avo chunky. 

Squeeze in the juice of 1/2 a lime, and add salt. Mix again and taste to check lime/salt balance. Add more of either if needed. 

Chop the tomato, and wash, dry, and rough chop the cilantro. Add them to the guac, and mix again. 

Taste again. *You probably need more salt.* Avoid the urge to overdo it on the lime juice though, as too much will overpower the avocado. 
### To serve

If serving right away, put it in a nice bowl, stick a tortilla chip in it for a garnish, take a picture of it and put it on Instagram[^1]. Then serve with tortilla chips, and use it as a garnish for the rest of your Mexican fiesta. 

If not eating right away, squeeze a little more lime juice over the top, cover and refrigerate up to a few hours.
