description: A list of recipes that we like
---

In addition to our own recipes (which are often adaptations of recipes that came before - let's not reinvent the wheel here folks!), there are a ton of great recipes that we find and use online. 

So partially for us to easily find, but also to share, here is a growing list of our favourites: 

### Breakfast
- [Sourdough pancakes](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/wprm_print/sourdough-pancakes-great-for-sourdough-discard) *(use up all that leftover [[Whole wheat sourdough bread#0. Sourdough starter|sourdough starter]]!!)* 
### Soups and salads
