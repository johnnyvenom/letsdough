## Steps

1. Cook rigatoni pasta al dente- be sure to save some pasta water.
2. Cook down the garlic and shallots in a good bit of olive oil until the shallots are softened.
3. Add in tomato paste and let that cook off for a few minutes - until itâ€™s not as bright in color.
4. Add in vodka and stir until the liquid is cooked off.
5. Add in heavy cream and stir until combined. Then season to taste with salt, pepper, and a generous amount of red pepper flakes.
6. Reduce heat to low. Add in your rigatoni. Add butter, a good sprinkle of parm, and a bit of your pasta water to bring everything together.
## To serve

Serve with a bit of basil and more parm!
