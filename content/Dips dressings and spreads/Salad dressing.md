![[IMG_3537.jpg]]

What to say? I (Mandeep) have been making this dressing for about 15 years. Maybe it could also be called as a health tonic as there's enough garlic and apple cider vinegar in it. Make a homemade salad dressing you love and you'll be ruined for ever going towards store-bought options.

> [!DANGER]+ 🥱 TL;DR
> (read on for the [long version](#full-recipe))
> 1. **Finely chop** garlic 
> 2. **Add** apple cider vinegar first
> 3. **Add** honey, mustard, olive oil 
> 4. **Shake** to emulsify 

# Full recipe
## Preparation time
- 10 min
## Ingredients

| Amount     | Ingredients              |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| 1-2 cloves | garlic (depends on size) |
| 2 tbsp     | apple cider vinegar      |
| 1 tsp      | honey                    |
| 1/2 tsp    | Dijon mustard            |
| 3.5 tbsp   | extra virgin olive oil   |
## Steps

> 💡I usually keep a glass jar or bottle reserved for this salad dressing

1. Finely chop garlic and put into a bottle or bowl.
2. Drown the garlic in apple cider vinegar so that its "bite" is tamed.
3. Add honey and Dijon mustard. 
4. Add olive oil last and then shake shake shake or stir stir stir.
5. Will keep in fridge for several days. 
6. I don't measure the dressing above, you can easily adjust to taste.

> [!tip] Substitutions
> - 💡 Substitute balsamic vinegar if you like
> - 💡 Substitute maple syrup for honey if you like
> - 🚨 *I don't recommend substituting yellow mustard, it makes the dressing too vinegar-y.* 
> - 👍 Lots of other improvisations with different oils and vinegars possible though! 
## To serve

>💡Take it out of fridge 15 minutes before using as the olive oil will be solid and need to liquify. Or run the bottle under hot water if you have no time. 

Put dressing on salad. Add salt and pepper as needed.

If using it on a kale salad: be sure to break the kale into smaller pieces, removing the stem, and massage kale leaves with olive oil before adding the dressing.
