Welcome to Let's Dough, a recipe Rolodex put together by [myself](https://johnnyvenom.com) and my partner [Mandeep](https://sociotekno.com/about). I make a lot of sourdough bread, but together we make so much incredible food it would be criminal not to share.

## About this wiki

Mandeep and I cook all the time. We are always trying new things, but also have our go-tos that we make over, and over, and over again. So this represents a selection of our go-to recipes that we've found, tried, adopted, adjusted, and tweaked to our liking. 

We also happen to be vegetarian, so if you are looking for meat recipes, this ain't it. 

I (Johnny) tend not to measure things too carefully, except when I am baking. So a lot of the recipes don't have exact measurements. In my own cooking, I aim to taste a lot, and let my senses guide me. I believe that working with simple quality, whole, fresh ingredients that are sourced as locally as possible leads to great results.

**Good ingredients in --> good food out.**

This wiki also is a little test environment for notetaking and web design/development workflows. I've used [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for years and have a lot of love for **_[static site generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator)_** like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This site uses [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) as a framework to publish an Obsidian vault of recipes. At some point maybe I'll post some notes on my journey with different tools and workflows. 

But for now, time to get back to the kitchen.

Let's dough!!!
