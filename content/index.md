Hi. I'm Johnny. Welcome to **Let's Dough**, a recipe Rolodex put together by [myself](https://johnnyvenom.com) and my partner [Mandeep](https://sociotekno.com/about). I make a lot of [[Whole wheat sourdough bread|sourdough bread]], but together we make so much other incredible food it would be criminal not to share.

## About the recipes

Mandeep and I cook all the time. We are always trying new things, but also have our go-tos that we make over, and over, and over again. So this represents a selection of our go-to recipes that we've found, tried, adopted, adjusted, and tweaked to our liking. 

We also happen to be vegetarian, so if you are looking for meat recipes, this ain't it. 

I (Johnny) tend not to measure things too carefully, except when I am baking. So a lot of the recipes don't have exact measurements. In my own cooking, I aim to taste a lot and let my senses guide me. I believe that working with simple, quality, whole, fresh ingredients that are sourced as locally as possible leads to great results.

## About this wiki

This wiki also is a little test environment for notetaking and web design/development workflows. I've used [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for years and have a lot of love for **_[static site generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator)_** like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This site uses [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) as a framework to publish an Obsidian vault of recipes. At some point maybe I'll post some notes on my journey with different tools and workflows.
